# Face-Mood-Recognation
 a website application that knows the current mood state of the user 


in order to run the application you have to run the code through localhost.

1- In VS code install "Live Server" extention
2- Open Index.html file 
3- In the bottom-right of the screen press on Go-Live button
4- Open the localhost:// on port 5500 (or any port that the extention will guide you to use)
 
HINT: you can use the localhost in the VS code (a small button in the bottom right of the compiler window named {Go Live} )
